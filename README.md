## Description

The goal of this project was to develop a React application that would offer classroom teachers a simplified way to access the website and database of Adventure 2 Learning content and resources. 
Teachers need content quickly and easily and this application is aimed to provide users with a more streamlined experience, faster, and more enjoyable to use.
As a start-up, this method is more cost-effective and can increase the amount of daily active users at a lesser cost to develop than a fully integrated mobile app.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

* User lands on homepage, clicks "Login" or "Register".
* User must create an account/login to view dashboard and utilize video search.
* Upon login, user is directed to dashboard landing-page.
* User can then enter key words or search terms in search box to pull results from temporary movie database.
* Search results with video thumbnails, title, description, release date, and relevant information is displayed.


### Future Development

* PWA components to allow app install on device and offline functionality
* Search/Filter options allowing user to save favorites for faster recall
* Sync to real A2L database and integrate video player for immediate playback on screen
